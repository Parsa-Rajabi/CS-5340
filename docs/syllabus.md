## Tutorial/Workshops

CPSC 344 has four "workshops" (listed as Tutorials on Workday). These sessions are designed to be hands-on and interactive, where students will work on assignments, projects, and other activities. The workshops are only conducted in-person, no recordings will be made available.

Workshop materials will be posted on course canvas page and mirrored on the course website.

| Section | Time                 | Location   |
| :-----: | -------------------- | ---------- |
|   T1A   | Thursday 10:00-12:00 | ICCS X360  |
|   T1B   | Thursday 16:00-18:00 | ICCS X360  |
|   T1C   | Thursday 18:00-20:00 | ICCS X360  |
|   T1D   | Friday 13:00-15:00   | ICCS X360  |
|   T1E   | Friday 11:00-13:00   | ICCS X360  |
|   T1F   | Friday 15:00-17:00   | ICCS X360  |
|   T1G   | Friday 17:00-19:00   | ICCS X360  |

Each tutorial/workshop will be temporarily closed at the beginning of the term. This is because we need to fill each workshop to its maximum of ~30; and thus must optimize students' schedule constraints to accommodate access by students who wish to take the course. During the first two weeks of the term, the teaching team assign each student to a tutorial session based on their schedule flexibility by running a workshop balancing survey (details announced in class). **Students on the waitlist must complete the survey in order to be considered for the course.**

## Course Description

> Basic tools and techniques, teaching a systematic approach to interface design, task analysis, analytic and empirical evaluation methods.
[UBC Academic Calender - CPSC 344](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/courses.php#hct)

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) design is "design for human use". Computers are a ubiquitous part of many interactions in our lives, from the mundane every-dayness of light switches and vending machines to entertainment and education to sophisticated instruments and complex energy and defense systems.

In this course, we will guide you to broaden your grasp of what a user interface can and should be, what computer science is and can be, and try your hand at doing better yourself. It is a fast-paced, hands-on, project-based experience designed around active lecture sessions supported by readings, assignments, and weekly workshop sessions, where students practice and explore the concepts introduced in lecture, and go well beyond them to learn and apply HCI techniques in the assignments that build into group projects.

Relationship to other UBC-CS HCI Courses ([Full listing of our HCI offerings](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/courses.php#hct)):
CPSC 344 and 444 form a two-course undergrad sequence; 444 covers more advanced evaluation material.

## Pre-requisites

- [CPSC 210](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=210) (or its equivalent) is a pre-requisite for CPSC 344.
- The main purpose of the pre-requisite is to ensure that you have experience **programming in at least two different languages**. Having mastered two, it is feasible to pick up another relatively easily; during prototyping you may need to quickly learn a new language as well as the ones you already know.
- The other most useful skill for you to bring to class is **experience working on a team**, a huge part of 344. You should also have **strong written and verbal communication ability**.

## Learning Goals

- Conceptual design: learn and use design techniques such as sketching, brainstorming, and storyboarding to develop design ideas given a set of requirements.
- Prototyping: learn and use prototyping techniques, tools, and frameworks to sketch, build and evaluate human-computer interfaces.
- Evaluation: learn and use evaluation techniques such as surveys, observations, and interviews; further, learn to combine them for complex research designs.
- Analyze: synthesize and present quantitative and qualitative data by identifying patterns in the data using descriptive statistics and thematic analytical techniques.
- Critique: learn how to critique interfaces in terms of design principles, human abilities and limitations, and evaluation heuristics.
- Process: learn how to reason about the stages of a design project, which questions are appropriate to ask at each stage, and how to choose the right research, prototyping, or evaluation technique to use.
- Understand: models of human cognition with respect to usability: human sensory systems, memory, mental models, and information processing abilities.
- Communicate: learn how to convey your design ideas through writing, oral presentation, critique sessions, group work, and whiteboarding.
- Collaborate: learn how to manage working with design briefs in a group setting, delegate and prioritize resources, communicate effectively within a group, and utilize group member strengths and support weaknesses

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. In addition, in your individual mark the peer component relates to your contributions and participation in your team. 

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:


1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally. It’s important to document these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 


## Academic Expectations

In addition to all university rules, regulations, and academic guidelines, the following policies will hold in CS344:

- Attendance and **prompt arrival** is expected at all classes and workshops. Quiz, assignment and team project marks will suffer from absences. In addition, there will be participation marks for in-class and workshop activities.
- There will be no makeup for the midterm. Students who miss the midterm will receive a grade of zero. 
- A student must pass the final exam in order to pass the course. If you fail the final exam (score < 50%), your final course grade will equal your final exam mark.

## Required Textbook

## UBC and Course Policies

### Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.”  

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the [UBC Academic Integrity guidelines](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-support/academic-integrity-citations/).

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, can be found [here](https://academicintegrity.ubc.ca/).

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) / ChatGPT Policy

The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is permitted with specific guidelines (subject to audits). Please refer to the [AI Policy](ai-policy.md) for more information.

### Course Waitlist

- Course waitlists are being handled centrally by the Computer Science department. Go [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists) for more information. Students who attend workshops will be given waitlist priority.
- If you do not plan to take the course, please remove yourself from the lecture or waitlist, so others may get in.
- Emails to the instructors/TAs about waitlist position will not be answered.

### Late Deliverables

- Late assignments and pre-reading quizzes will receive no credit. 
- In the extraordinary circumstance (e.g., medical or family emergency) that you are prevented from completing and submitting components on time, or fully participating in your group's work, we may allow late turn-in. In this case, contact your TA or the course staff well in advance of the deadline (a usual expectation would be 24 hours). At the discretion of staff considering the circumstance, a penalty may still be imposed of a mark reduction of 0.98^(hours late).

### Remarking Policy

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written case for the re-marking and be submitted to the course instructor(s) within 5 business days from receiving the mark. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final.
